### 2.1 Introduction to Python Data Structure

#### 2.1.1 Python data type

##### Tuple

  A type of **unchangeable** set that contains objects with data in **different** types.

##### List

  A type of **changeable** set that contains objects with data in **the same** type. We can use '+' to link together two lists.

##### Array

##### Dictionary

  A type of **unordered** data structure, with each object a **key** and a **value**. Find a value by using dic['key'].

##### DataFrame

  A type of data structure defined in package pandas, mainly used in statistic data with colume names.

#### 2.1.2 index and slice

  using code like 'object[int a:int b:int c]' to call an index or slice, where a means the starting object, b means the next object after the last one we need, and c means the step with value 1 when default.
